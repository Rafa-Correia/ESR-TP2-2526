Notes!

Basic stuff:

    There are 4 types of nodes: Client, Node, Streamer, Bootstraper. Node, Streamer and Bootstraper
    are basically the same, we can even start a streamer as like python ./node.py --streamer (same for bootstraper).

    The client explicitely requests streams, and never streams itself.

    The Bootstraper should only be used at the beggining, to build the network. Any further comms with it afterwards
    is strictly forbidden!
